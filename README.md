* disable relative numbers in the quickfix window,
* quickfix buffers are hidden from `:ls` and buffer navigation,
* optional Ack.vim-inspired mappings,
* optional mappings for `:cnext`, `:cprevious`, `:lnext`, `:lprevious`
* that wrap around the beginning an end of the list,
* optional mapping for jumping to and from the location/quickfix window,
* filter/restore the list,
* perform commands on each line in the list,
* perform commands on each file in the list,
* open the location/quickfix window automatically after `:make`, `:grep`, `:lvimgrep` and friends if there are valid locations/errors
* quit Vim if the last window is a location/quickfix window
* close location window automatically when quitting parent window
